# Mechanic2DayMobileApp
React native, Mobile application coded using React Native, Express.JS, Node.JS, MongoDB, WebSockets, Redux, building and consuming REST API's and much more...

STEPS BEFORE RUNNING APP...

1) change into the server outter most layer/directory of the application and run "npm install" (assuming you have node installed)
2) change into the react native inner layer directory and run "npm install"

NOTE: You must use ngrok tunneling to proxy to the emulator for API calls

To start... run "npm start" in the outter layer directory where the server.js file is and this will start the server. Go into xcode and start the project like you would any other project in the ios directory and you're good to go!

***make sure to start ngrok too***
